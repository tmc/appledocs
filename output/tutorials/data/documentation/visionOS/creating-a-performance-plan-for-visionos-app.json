Performance tuning means making your app run as efficiently as possible, so it does more work in less time and with fewer system resources. Efficiency is especially important on devices that can support multiple apps in an immersive experience. Apps that consume too many resources, can push the device beyond thermal limits. When this occurs, the system takes steps to cool down to a more acceptable level. This can have a noticeable visual impact and be disorienting for the wearer.",
